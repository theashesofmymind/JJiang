         <p style="font-size: 14px; text-align: left; margin-right: 0vw; line-height:1.5"> As a sculptor, I personify objects to build unconventional phenomena. Personifying is achieved through visualizing gravity, scale, material property, and decay on objects at site-specific places. Picture a flesh-colored silicone-casted apple filled with expired pills, affixed to a fruit tree by an arrow, or an X-ray machine calibrated for airplane engine scale capturing a small nesting doll. I delve into the subjectivities evoked by objects and their relationships with the human body. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Growing up in a peripatetic family exposed me to diverse cultural and historical barriers, fostering a fascination with how individuals enact their personalities and unspeakable emotions through their way of sensing and treating objects. I recall realizing that a pulled-out metal plate in flight was called a ‘table’; I repurposed an obsolete airplane seat belt, installing it on gallery ground. Objects as a language to communicate, are extensions of the body, carrying a sense of continuity across time and space.
        <br>
        <br>
        Through my research, I have identified an epistemological rupture between social science, language, and bioscience caused by the human body. To bridge these ruptures and recuperate the body's value, I conceptualize the 'subject' as a fluid and uncertain assemblage rather than a solid, unitary origin. My approach involves using various sets of materials to construct one specific object. I employ mis-context, mis-figure, and mis-function as methods to investigate unconventional phenomena. For instance, I created an object resembling a Band-Aid from a bedding set, placing it in a public library. Its material speaks of a human bed, its figure aligns with our recognition of a Band-Aid, the exclamation mark-shaped scar delves into semiotics, and its scale relates to the surrounding walkway. I perceive my work as a portal facilitating the traversal between subjectivities, transcending cultural and historical barriers. Portal is rooted in the language of materiality embedded in our world before our arrival, constituting the entire earth. Only 1.5mm plexiglass can float on the Yangtze River without drifting away. Heating pad powder with a 1mm crust melts the edges of the butter without turning it into oil. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Looking ahead, my exploration of epistemology and materiality will deepen, probing the psychological and physical constraints that shape viewers’ interpretation. I foresee a greater integration of technology, fostering a border conversation between object and subject. I aim to transcend traditional boundaries, retraining senses on the fusion between objects, bodies, and the spaces we inhabit.

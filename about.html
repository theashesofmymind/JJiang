In doing so, I explore their subjectivity and how they relate to the human body. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Growing up in a peripatetic family, I flew constantly with them all around the world. Communication was always constrained by cultural, and historical barriers, including language. However, I saw people enacting their personalities and unspeakable emotions through their way of sensing and treating objects. I recognized while in flight a pulled-out metal plate was called a ‘table’. I got the feeling of home when my father arranged the domestic items in a specific order on each hotel sink. Objects are extensions of the body and carry a sense of continuity throughout time and space. In my work, I build unconventional phenomena by playing with the language of objects in order to value individuals who don’t have a cultural or historical sense of belonging. Therefore, I form transcendent connections rooted in materiality and body. 
        <br>
        <br>
        From my research, I have come to understand that the human body makes an epistemological rupture between social science, language, and bioscience. Accordingly, I explore contemporary ‘subject’ as a fluid and uncertain assemblage instead of a solid unitary origin, representing it by using different sets of materials for making one specific object. To bridge ruptures and recuperate the value of the body, I construct uncommon relationships between objects and their senses to conceive a hidden connection beyond social norms. Taking objects as the entry point, I use mis-context, mis-figure, and mis-function as three methods to investigate the rootless state. The metonymy of the body engagement can be discovered visually through a temporal force, temperature, or vigor in the relations of objects. In my work, an X-ray machine specifically for airplane engine scale is adjusted to shoot a nesting doll; a chunk of melted wax can be found in a vacuum form which mimics a breast; an exclamation-mark-shaped scar is made of a bed mattress for enacting the center of a band-aid. My work as materialized transcendental portals enables traveling in between subjectivities, by using the language of materiality which existed before we came here and constitutes the entire earth.
